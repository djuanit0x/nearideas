Exploring The Code
==================

1. The "backend" code lives in the `/contract` folder. This code gets deployed to
   the NEAR blockchain when you run `yarn deploy:contract`.
2. The frontend code lives in the `/src` folder. `/src/index.html` is a great
   place to start exploring. Note that it loads in `/src/index.js`.
